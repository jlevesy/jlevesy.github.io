                                        <p>As part of the VOI Platform team, I am in charge of maintaining the platform and tooling that supports the VOI way of working, from the core infrastructure on GCP, to the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions and ArgoCD), through monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana and Mimir). In less than a year, I have accomplished amongst other things the successful zero downtime migration of our workload to separate namespaces and the rollout of <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/mimir/">Grafana Mimir</a> as our metric storage backend. My proficiency with Go and Kubernetes allowed me to make meaningful contributions across our application stack and to be recognized as a technical reference in our organization. This is also a very productive period for me as an open source developer as my position inspired me many side projects like <a href="https://github.com/jlevesy/kudo">kudo</a>, a Kubernetes controller that allows to implement secure permission escalation, and <a href="https://github.com/jlevesy/kxds">kxds</a>, a control plane for gRPC xDS service discovery. I also won the <a href="https://traefik.io/blog/meet-your-hackaethon-winners/">second prize of the Traefik 3.0 Haekathon</a> with my work integrating SPIFFE with Traefik. Last but not least, I implemented an <a href="https://github.com/jlevesy/prometheus-elector">highly available solution to push metrics to Mimir using Prometheus Agents and Kubernetes Leader Election</a> which got <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/11665#issuecomment-1340781321">very good feedback</a> from the Prometheus maintainers. For more information see the project section.</p>

On the technical side, I wrote amongst other things the support for Instagram stories, an ETL pipeline for email analysis, performed various infrastructure updates and contributed to major new features of the platform. As a team leader, I succesfully set up a developement workflow from the feature inception to production. This contribution greatly improved the team productity while ensuring an acceptable workload and provides a better visibility to other stakeholders of the company.</p>

                                        <p>kXDS is a Kubernetes native xDS control plane for gRPC. Modern versions of gRPC includes <a href="https://grpc.github.io/grpc/cpp/md_doc_grpc_xds_features.html">an extensive support of Envoy&rsquo;s xDS protocol</a> which allows to implement advanced service to service traffic routing without relying on an external reverse proxy: everything is embedded in the client. Unfortunately there are very few control planes available that supports this feature. As a consequence, I started to write kXDS as an attempt to provide a Kubernetes native control plane which allows to provide an advanced routing configuration to gRPC clients using a Kubernetes custom resource.

                                        <p>During my time at VOI, I had the opportunity to explore SPIRE as a way to provide strong verifiable identity to our workload and enable end to end encryption via TLS and mTLS from the web browser to the database. One of the pain points we identified is the first hop between the ingress controller and an HTTP API server. After investigating a bit, I started to build a <a href="https://github.com/jlevesy/spire-testbed">testbed</a> which allowed me to develop a working proof of concept for making Traefik compatible with SPIRE. I then decided to <a href="https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/9376">open a proposal</a> and turned my proof of concept into a successful <a href="https://github.com/traefik/traefik/pull/9394">contribution</a> that got me the <a href="https://traefik.io/blog/meet-your-hackaethon-winners">second prize of the Traefik 3.0 Haekathon</a>.</p>

                                        <p>One of the topics I had to work on at VOI is the deployment of Mimir as a metrics storage backend to use accross all our Kubernetes cluster. One challenge we had to solve is how to have multiple agents per monitored clusters to guarantee high availability on the agent side. The solution built into Mimir is to run a server side deduplication of the pushed samples which requires running an etcd cluster. I didn&rsquo;t find this satisfying (because etcd is a complex beast to run) so, I went on and wrote prometheus-elector which allows to run a kubernetes leader election accross multiple replicas of prometheus and make sure that only the leader is actually pushing samples to Mimir.
